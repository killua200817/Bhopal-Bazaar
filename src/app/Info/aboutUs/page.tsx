						<p>
							It began with a craving, not just for food, but for belonging.
						</p>
						<p>
							During the pandemic, what started as a simple wish to get paan
							delivered unraveled into something bigger. As we spoke to family,
							friends, and local vendors, a deeper pattern emerged: Why, in a
							world of on-demand everything, are our cultural groceries still so
							hard to access, so invisibly served? Why do the vendors who’ve fed
							our families for decades still manage inventory by memory, not
							tech? Why are we, one of the largest immigrant communities in the
							U.S., still navigating aisles of neglect in the digital economy?
						</p>
						<p className="font-semibold">
							These aren’t just logistical gaps. They’re identity gaps. And
							BHOPAL BAZAAR is our answer.
						</p>
						<p>
							BHOPAL BAZAAR is a Bhopal grocery delivery platform built to bridge
							culture, convenience, and community. We&apos;re not just
							delivering products, we&apos;re preserving home. We’re empowering
							small, often-overlooked Bhopal vendors with modern tools to
							thrive. We’re creating a system where heritage and technology
							don’t compete; they collaborate.
						</p>
						<p>
							We’ve spent countless hours, between college classes, jobs, and
							leadership roles, building BHOPAL BAZAAR from the ground up. And this past
							week, our vision was recognized:
						</p>
						<p className="font-semibold">
							We were named Finalists at the 2025 Starting Dock: Shippensburg’s
							Entrepreneurial Launchpad.
						</p>
						<p>
							From messy sketches to investor pitches, and now to our MVP launch
							just around the corner, this moment is more than a milestone. It’s
							a message.
